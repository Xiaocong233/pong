## Description
This is a replicate of the classic video game, pong, I made using programming language Lua.
I created low level game functions like the screen and object rendering, collision detections, elastic collision (bouncing), manipulation of speed.
In addition, I added a simple AI system that tracks the ball's movement in order to fight against the player.

## Usage
download game engine: LOVE
clone the entire game folder and drag it onto the LOVE application to open the game

## What I have learned
* Programming in Lua, Visual Studio Code
* Game Development in LOVE the game engine
* Rendering objects in real time
* Collision detections using Axis Alligned Bounding Box collision detection system
* Creating virtual height/width
* Utilization of delta time
* Usage of game states
* Scoring system in games
* Evaluating current Frames Per Second and display it on player's screen
